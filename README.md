# 🧠 DSA Practice Repository (C++)

This repository contains my growing collection of Data Structures & Algorithms practice solutions in **C++**.  
I am currently focusing on building a strong foundation for SDE internship preparation by solving problems topic-wise from LeetCode.

---

## 📘 Current Progress
- **20 problems solved so far**
- Focusing on: Arrays, Strings, Sliding Window, Hashing
- Goal: **100 problems by the end of this semester**

I will keep updating this repository as I learn new patterns and solve more problems.

## 📂 Folder Structure
Problems are organized by topic:

- `Arrays/`
- `Strings/`
- `SlidingWindow/`
- `TwoPointers/`
- `Hashing/`
- *(More folders will be added as I progress)*

## 🎯 Goals
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals  
- Practice consistently for internship coding rounds  
- Learn common patterns used in DSA interviews  
- Maintain a clean and organized coding habit
